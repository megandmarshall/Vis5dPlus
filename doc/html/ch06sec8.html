>     Wind trajectories trace the motion of air through the 3-D volume much line
smoke trails in a wind tunnel.  To enter trajectory mode select the TRAJECTORY
radio button on the control panel.  A pop-up window will appear near the bottom
of the screen and a 3-D cursor will appear inside the 3-D view box.  This 3-D
cursor is used to specify where a new wind trajectory should be made.  The STEP
button on the main control panel is also important because it is used to select
the time step at which to create the trajectory.</P
><P
>     Wind trajectories are dealt with in sets.  Currently, eight sets are
available.  Each set is represented in the trajectory window with a button
labeled Set1, Set2, ..., Set8.  Each set can be individually displayed, colored,
or deleted.  As you create new trajectories you may want to group them in sets
corresponding to location, time, etc.</P
><P
>     The first step in creating a trajectory is to select a position with the 3-
D cursor.  Use the right mouse button to drag the 3-D cursor around inside the 3-
D box.  The 3-D cursor will move in 2-D in a plane parallel to the plane of
projection.  That is, the cursor will stay at a constant distance of depth.  By
alternately rotating the view box with the left mouse button and placing the
cursor with the right mouse button, the 3-D cursor can be placed anywhere inside
the view box.  The TOP, SOUTH, and WEST buttons as explained in 
<A
HREF="ch06sec2.html"
>section 6.2</A
> can
also be useful when making trajectories.</P
><P
>     Second you should select a time step with the STEP button on the control
panel.  When the trajectory is made, it will be traced forward from the current
time step to the last time step and will be traced backward through time to the
first time step.</P
><P
>     Finally, to make a trajectory at the current cursor location and current
time step, press the middle mouse button when pointing inside the 3-D window.
The trajectory will appear as a line segment.  By turning on the ANIMATE button,
you can observe how the trajectory travels through time and space.  Typically,
you will repeat the process of positioning the 3-D cursor and clicking the
middle mouse button to create a set of trajectories.</P
><P
>     Interesting results can be seen by making a trajectory when the ANIMATE
button is turned on:  a trajectory will be created for every time step instead
of just one.  This will show you the path of every air parcel which passes
through a single point in space.</P

        To position the 3-D cursor, use a combination of rotating the view box

        trajectories window.  You will asked to verify your decision.</P

        You can delete the last trajectory made by clicking on the 'Delete
        Last' button in the trajectories window.</P

><P
>     Wind trajectories can be depicted in two ways:  as line segments or as
ribbons.  You can select ribbons by clicking on the RIBBON button in the
trajectory window.  Toggling the RIBBON button will not effect trajectories you
have already made; it only controls how new trajectories will be displayed.</P
><P
>     The trajectory window also contains two type-in widgets labeled STEP and
LENGTH.  The STEP value is used to control the step size used in the trajectory
tracing algorithm.  The LENGTH value is used to control the length of
trajectories.  1.0 is the default value for each.  Each acts as a multiplier.
If you want the trajectory tracer to integrate in steps 1/2 the default size,
enter a step value of 0.5.  If you want trajectories to be twice as long as the
default length, enter a length value of 2.0</P
><P
>     The color of trajectories is controlled in the same way as for isosurfaces.
That is, a trajectory set may either be mono-colored or colored according to
another physical variable.  Click on the trajectory set button with the right
mouse button to bring up its color window.  
See <A
HREF="ch06sec5.html#CH06SEC5.1"
>section 6.5.1</A
> for details on
using the color window.</P
><P
>     When viewing color-mapped trajectores be aware that the color of a
trajectory is time dependent.  Only the head of the trajectory is colored
according to the value of another variable for the current time step.  The tail
of the trajectory is colored according to the color of the other variable when
the head was at that location.</P
