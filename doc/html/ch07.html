><P
>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>v5dimport</B
> utility is a program for converting grid files to v5d 
format, combining multiple source files, resampling to new coordinate 
systems and culling variables and timesteps.  It has both a graphical 
and command line user interface.</P
><P
>For example, you may use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>v5dimport</B
> to read 2 McIDAS GR3D files and a 2-D
McIDAS GRID file, resample all the data to a Lambert Conformal 
projection, omit the CWAT and VORT variables and then write the data to 
a Vis5D file called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>lambert1.v5d</TT
>.</P

> It's often the case that one wants to discard some physical variables or
 timesteps from the input file so they aren't written to the output file.
 By default, all variables are selected for output.</P
><P
> To select/cull variables, click on the "Select by variable..." button.  
 A pop-up window will appear which lists all the variables.  
 The ones that are highlighted are selected for ouput.  
 Click on variables names to select or deselect them.</P
><P
> Similarly, you can select timesteps via the "Select by time..." button.
 A pop-up window listing all time steps will appear.  
 Use the mouse to select the time steps you want and unselect the 
 timesteps you wish to omit.  Note that you can select/deselect a number 
 of timsteps by just dragging the mouse while holding down the button.</P
><P
> Finally, grids may be selected or discarded according to their map
 projection or vertical coordinate system (VCS) via the "Select by
 projectiion..." and "Select by VCS... buttons.</P
><P
> Note that as you select/deselect timesteps, variables, projections, 
 or VCSs the effected grids will be high-lighted/unhigh-lighted in 
 the main grid list.</P

><P
> The default parameters for the output file (grid size, projection, etc) 
 are taken from the first file read in.  
 You should always review these parameters before making your output 
 file. It will often be necessary to change these values.</P
><P
> The number of rows, columns, and levels for the output file is 
 specified by the type-in fields on the main window labeld "Rows", 
 "Columns" and "Max Levels". Type in new values if the defaults are 
 incorrect.</P
><P
> The map projection for the output file can be viewed and changed by
 clicking on the "Map projection..." button.  In this pop-up window 
 you'll be able to choose a map projection type then enter the 
 specific projection parameters.  There is also a "Guess" button 
 which will attempt to find a reasonable output projection given the 
 currently selected grid list.  It's often helpful to have the 
 "Select by Projection" pop-up window on-screen to compare the output 
 projection to the input projections.</P
><P
> The vertical coordinate system for the output file can be viewed and
 changed by clicking on the "Vertical Coord System..." button.  
 In this pop-up window you'll be able to choose a vertical coordinate 
 system type and enter the specific parameters.  This window also has 
 a "Guess" button to try to find a reasonable default.  
 Similarly, it's often helpful to have the "Select by VCS" pop-up window 
 on-screen to compare the output VCS to the input VCSs.</P

><P
> Enter a filename for the output file in the type-in field at the 
 bottom of the main window then click on "Make".  
 Messages will be printed as the file conversion takes place.  
 If there are any errors the process will halt.  Note that generating 
 the output file can be time-consuming if data must be resampled
 from the input grid's coordinate system to a new coordinate system 
 for the output file.</P
><P
>     If you click on "Visualize" this will make the file and then automatically
start up Vis5D on that file (i.e., you don't need to click on "Make" first).  If
you type a filename in the type-in field, it wil use that name.  Otherwise, it
will use your login name followed by ".v5d".  If you want command line options
on the Vis5D command, put them in a file named 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vis5d_options</TT
>.  For example, <TT

><I
>-mbs 64</I

>     The first item controls the "combining of co-located data".  It may be the
case that several 3-D grids, selected for output, are co-located in space and
time.  When computing the value to put in the output file you can either choose
the data value from the higher resolution grid at that location, or take the
average of all grid values at that grid location.</P
><P
>     The second item controls how grid data is compressed in the output file.
By default, grid values are scaled down to 1-byte integers.  Alternately, you
can scale down to 2-byte integers for better resolution, or perform no
compression/scaling by selecting 4-byte floating point values.  This option
respresents a tradeoff in file size and precision.</P
