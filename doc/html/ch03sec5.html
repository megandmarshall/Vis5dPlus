>     One method for getting irregular data into vis5d is to use the
irregular importer.  The 'IRG IMPORT' button can be found on the Vis5D
control panel which will invoke the irregular importer.  The control
panel will be brought up when loading a regular v5d file or it can be
brought up by typing </P

>     In the importer there is a "File List."  Pressing the "Load
File..." button will bring up a file browser where one can select the
NetCDF files to load.  Any number of NetCDF files may be loaded at one
time.  Once these files are loaded a list of unique times and
variables will be created and displayed.  The user can
highlight/unhighlight desired times and variables.  Frequently there
may be a large number of times which do not contain much data.  The
"FILTER" button can be used to quickly select certain times.</P
><P
>     Once the desired files have been selected the user will need to
assign a "Dataset Name"  and select the memory pool size (default
32M).  The "Load" button will then load the selected files and data
into vis5d.</P
><P
>     The irregular importer can currently read three types of NetCDF
files.  The first type of file is created by translating the Aviation
Routine Weather Reports (METARs) and the Aviation Selected Special
Reports (SPECIs) to NetCDF format, using the 
<A
HREF="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/decoders/decoders-2.3.5.tar.Z"
TARGET="_top"
>Unidata decoders</A
>. 
More information about these decoders and METAR data can be found at
the 
<A
HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu"
TARGET="_top"
>Unidata</A
>
web site. The other two types of data
that can be read are METARs converted to the 
<A
HREF="http://www.fsl.noaa.gov/"
TARGET="_top"
> 
FSL (Forecast Systems Laboratory)</A
>
NetCDF format and profiles which are also converted to the
FSL NetCDF format.</P
><P
>     It is possible to read other NetCDF formats with the irregular
importer but it requires the addition of source code to the importer.
If one is familiar with C programming and the 
<A
HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>NetCDF </A
>
file structure it would not be a hard task. 
The two files: 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>file.c</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>iapi.c</TT
>
would require the additions and they are found in the source code.</P

><A
HREF="ftp://www.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/vis5d-5.2/vis5d-irregular-data.tar.Z"
TARGET="_top"
>     Sample METAR data </A
>
in both the Unidata and FSL formats can be
downloaded.
This tar file also contains a gridded v5d file of an NGM
model run. The time frame of this v5d file coincides with the Unidata
METAR files.  One can overlay both a regular v5d data set and an
irregular data set in the same display.</P
><P
>     The second method for incorporating irregular data into vis5d is
the creation of a new import program or converter.  This program would
read the user's file format and insert the data into vis5d via the
irregular_v5d library calls.  The functions that would need to be
called and information about them are found in the src file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/vis5d-5.2/src/irregular_v5d.c</TT
>.  
This route for getting irregular data into vis5d is suggested for 
experienced programmers only.</P
